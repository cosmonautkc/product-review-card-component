## Overview

This is my solution for the Product preview card component. The goal was to recreate the layout as closely as possible, in both desktop and mobile views.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS tokens/variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries
  -Psuedo class for hover state

### What I learned

I learnt more about how flexbox works in terms of responsive design and what styles have to be reconsidered when moving from a column layout to a row layout. I also improved my ability to create css tokens and think clearly on how to structure them for scalability and debugging.

### Continued development

The responsive side of the challenge was difficult for me as I had written code that would affect me in the future. I will focus on actively thinking about what styles I choose, why I choose them, and whether I would still use it if the component is going to be responsive.
